# Atari 2600 Emulator with Rust Web Assembly based 6507 CPU

This project aims to faithfully replicate an Atari 2600 machine in a browser. It is an educational project with several key goals:

1. Reuse the cycle accurate 6502 emulator I wrote for <https://github.com/DaveTCode/nes-emulator-rust>
2. Learn about web assembly

For a genuine Atari 2600 emulator please see [Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io/). For a better example of a web based emulator please see <https://github.com/6502ts/6502.ts>.
